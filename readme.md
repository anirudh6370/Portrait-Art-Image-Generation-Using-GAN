# GAN for Art Portraits Generation

![Generated Art Portraits](example_generated_portraits.png)

## Overview
This project explores the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate art portraits. The GAN architecture is trained on a dataset of art portraits and learns to generate realistic-looking portraits.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the GAN consists of art portraits collected from various sources, including online art databases and image-sharing platforms. The dataset contains a diverse range of art styles and subjects, providing the GAN with a broad learning experience.

## Architecture
The GAN architecture comprises a generator and a discriminator. The generator takes random noise as input and generates art portraits, while the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of the generated portraits. The generator and discriminator are trained adversarially to improve the quality of the generated portraits over time.

## Training Process
The GAN is trained using a combination of adversarial training and gradient descent optimization. The training process involves iteratively updating the weights of the generator and discriminator networks to minimize the adversarial loss and improve the quality of the generated portraits.

## Results
After training the GAN for 30 epochs, the generator is capable of producing high-quality art portraits that closely resemble real art pieces. The generated portraits exhibit a diverse range of styles and subjects, demonstrating the effectiveness of the GAN architecture for art generation tasks.

you can train for more epochs for better results

## Improvement Over Time (AVI file)
The project includes an AVI file showcasing the improvement in the generation of art portraits over time during the training process. The AVI file provides a visual representation of how the quality of the generated portraits evolves with each training iteration.
